# Welcome to the Mobberode Mutated Barebones Alpha!
Mobberode Mutated is a wave defense and roguelike hybrid that players have to cooperate to survive the endless onslaught.
## Why is Mobberode Mutated in a "Barebones" Alpha?
Mobberode Mutated is in a "Barebones" Alpha due to not having all the content yet still in a playable state from start to finish alongside bugs that may get discovered and will need fixing.

**Important note beforehand**:\
Mobberode Mutated completely replaces the vanilla, survival experience and it's recommended to play in worlds made for Mobberode Mutated
Can I suggest feedback and report bugs?
Yes. You may send feedback, suggestions and bug reports and that will be looked at in the Mobberode Discord

***How often will this be worked on?***\
Expect daily commits to the Mobberode Mutated repository on GitHub which may change things, add in new features or remove features as the gameplay is not final.

***How can I play the Mobberode Mutated Barebones Alpha?***\
Downloading will give you a world that contains the minigame datapack. This is to be tested preferably on the latest snapshots (1.21.2 Pre-Release 3+) Versions earlier than the latest snapshot will be ignored as there are no plans to support versions 1.21.1 and under.

***Do I need to pay in order to play?***\
Stupid question, obviously no. This minigame will always be free for the foreseeable future despite its quality so don't worry.

***I'm hosting a Mobberode Mutated server, but players are just not starting the game!***\
If you are hosting a server. Set the score of #State mbm.internal.config.is_server to 1 which introduces a time limit of 5 minutes for players to start the game.\
(â€‹1 = Enabled, 0 = Disabled)

***What content is there to Mobberode Mutated | Barebones Alpha?***\
Mobberode Mutated contains multiple features:
- Saves\
Saves allow players to save their progress and come back to it at a later date. Saves can save and load data like attributes, effects, wave data, inventories, position and rotation from each player's playerdata.
- Spawnpoint Energy\
Spawnpoint Energy is a form of how players can come back during a match. Spawnpoint Energy can be gained passively or be gained from other teammates doing tasks such as killing mobs. Deaths can, however, deduct 10% of Spawnpoint Energy from all non-alive players to the point of negative.
- Wave System\
Mobberode Mutated as a wave defense will have to contain a wave system as obvious as it is. It's pretty self explanatory so no need to explain further on this one.
- Death Penalty\
The penalty punishes players who die frequently by halving their arrows and stews. Every death also deducts 10% from all player's Spawnpoint Energy as a further incentive to not die.
Closing notes about the Barebones Alpha

**Gameplay is not final and is subject to change. Adjustments to both mechanics and difficulty may be made. Bugs will be found and will need to be reported to the Mobberode Discord for quality.**
